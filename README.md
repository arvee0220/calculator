# Calculator App

Created using Vite React & Sass

I did not focus much on styling as this project is to showcase my code structure.

This app has two branches:
main branch: Uses single component(App.jsx) and implementation of useState hook.
context branch: Implementation of Software Engineering Principles such as DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS(Keep It Simple, Stupid), Separation of Concerns, Modularity and Encapsulation. I also implemented the use of createContext and useContext hook.
